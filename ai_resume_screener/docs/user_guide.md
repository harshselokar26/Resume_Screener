#### **Stage 2: Feature Engineering**
```
Tokens â†’ Named Entities â†’ Skills â†’ Experience â†’ Education â†’ Keywords
```

**Feature Categories:**
- **Technical Skills**: Programming languages, frameworks, tools
- **Soft Skills**: Communication, leadership, teamwork
- **Experience Metrics**: Years of experience, job titles, companies

#### **Stage 3: Similarity Computation**
```
Resume Features + Job Features â†’ Vector Space â†’ Similarity Score
```

**Similarity Algorithms:**
1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**
   - Term Frequency: How often terms appear in document
   - Inverse Document Frequency: Rarity of terms across corpus
   - Vector Creation: Numerical representation of text

2. **Cosine Similarity**
   - Formula: `cos(Î¸) = (AÂ·B) / (||A|| Ã— ||B||)`
   - Range: 0 to 1 (0 = no similarity, 1 = identical)
   - Measures angle between vectors, not magnitude

3. **Semantic Similarity**
   - Word embeddings from spaCy's language model
   - Contextual understanding of synonyms and related terms
   - Handles variations in terminology
